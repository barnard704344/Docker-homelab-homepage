# Homelab Homepage

A lightweight Docker container that provides an interactive homepage for your homelab with automatic network service discovery.

## Features

- **Interactive Homepage**: Clean web interface with service cards, search, and status monitoring
- **Network Scanning**: Automatic nmap-based discovery of web services on your network
- **Port Detection**: Shows all open ports for discovered services with clickable port buttons
- **Service Pinning**: Pin your favorite services - pins are stored server-side and sync across browsers
- **On-Demand Scanning**: Trigger network scans from the web interface
- **Reverse DNS**: Shows hostnames for discovered devices
- **Status Monitoring**: Live service availability indicators

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/barnard704344/Docker-homelab-homepage.git
cd Docker-homelab-homepage
docker build -t homepage .
```

2. **Run with host networking (recommended):**
```bash
docker run -d 
  --name homepage 
  --network host 
  -e SUBNETS="192.168.1.0/24" 
  -e SCAN_INTERVAL=10 
  homepage
```

3. **Access at:** `http://localhost/` or `http://<your-server-ip>/`

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `SUBNETS`: Networks to scan (default: `192.168.1.0/24`)
- `SCAN_INTERVAL`: Minutes between automatic scans (optional)

Multiple networks:
```bash
-e SUBNETS="192.168.1.0/24 10.0.1.0/24"
```

## Usage

### Web Interface
- **Search**: Press `/` or use search box
- **Pin Services**: Click üìå to pin frequently used services
- **Port Selection**: Click port numbers to use specific ports for services
- **Run Scans**: Use "üîç Run Scan" button to discover new services
- **View Scans**: Access scan results via "Network Scan" links

### Port Scanning
The scanner now detects **all ports** (top 10,000) instead of just web ports. All discovered ports are shown as clickable buttons on each service card.

### Service Discovery
- Automatically finds web services on your network
- Shows services with hostnames (skips IP-only devices)
- Creates clickable service cards with all available ports
- Updates after each scan completes

## Maintenance

**Rebuild after updates:**
```bash
git pull
./rebuild.sh  # or manually stop/rm/build/run
```

**Debug scan issues:**
```bash
curl http://localhost/debug.php
docker logs homepage
```

**Manual scan:**
```bash
docker exec homepage /usr/local/bin/scan.sh
```

## File Structure

- `site/index.html` - Main homepage interface
- `site/pins.php` - Server-side pin storage API
- `scan.sh` - Network scanning script (nmap with top 10k ports)
- `parse-scan.sh` - Converts scan results to JSON with port data
- `Dockerfile` - Alpine Linux with nginx, PHP-FPM, nmap

## License

MIT

Confirm it's running:
```bash
docker ps --filter name=homepage
```

Test nginx from inside the container:
```bash
docker exec homepage curl -v http://127.0.0.1/
``` scanner (`nmap`), and **automatic service discovery** from network scans.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/barnard704344/Docker-homelab-homepage.git
cd Docker-homelab-homepage
```

### 2) Build
```bash
docker build -t homelab-homepage .
```

### 3) Run (with host networking for network scanning)
**Important**: Use `--network host` for reliable network scanning capabilities.

Stop/remove any existing container:
```bash
docker stop homepage 2>/dev/null || true
docker rm   homepage 2>/dev/null || true
```

Run with host networking (recommended):
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name homepage \
  --network host \
  -e SUBNETS="192.168.1.0/24" \
  -e SCAN_INTERVAL=10 \
  homepage
```

> **Access**: `http://<HOST_LAN_IP>/` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.20/`) - Uses port 80 with host networking

#### Alternative Configurations
- **Port mapping** (network scanning may have limitations):
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
    --name homepage \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -e SUBNETS="192.168.1.0/24" \
    -e RUN_SCAN_ON_START=1 \
    homepage
  ```
- **Multiple subnets**:
  ```bash
  -e SUBNETS="192.168.1.0/24 10.72.28.0/22 10.136.40.0/24"
  ```

## üîç Scanning Features

### Web Interface Scanning
- **Click "üîç Run Scan" button** on the homepage to trigger scans instantly
- No SSH access required - scan directly from your browser
- Real-time feedback with scan status indicators

### Scan Results Access
- **Homepage links**: Direct links to scan results in the "Monitoring" section
- Inside container: `/var/www/site/scan/last-scan.txt` (plus symlink `/var/www/site/scan.txt`)
- In browser:
  - `http://<HOST_LAN_IP>:8080/scan/last-scan.txt`
  - `http://<HOST_LAN_IP>:8080/scan.txt`

### Manual Command Line Scanning
Trigger a manual scan from command line:
```bash
docker exec homepage /usr/local/bin/scan.sh
```

Run the service discovery parser separately:
```bash
docker exec homepage /usr/local/bin/parse-scan.sh
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Built-in Debug Tools
The container includes several debugging tools:

**Debug endpoint** (check service discovery status):
```bash
curl http://localhost/debug.php
```

**Debug parser script** (comprehensive diagnostics):
```bash
docker exec homepage /usr/local/bin/debug-parser.sh
```

**Manual testing**:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker logs homepage

# Access container shell
docker exec -it homepage /bin/sh

# Check file permissions
docker exec homepage ls -la /var/www/site/

# Verify scan results
docker exec homepage cat /var/www/site/scan/last-scan.txt

# Check services.json
docker exec homepage cat /var/www/site/services.json
```

### Common Issues

**Services not appearing after scan:**
1. Check debug endpoint: `curl http://localhost/debug.php`
2. Run debug script: `docker exec homepage /usr/local/bin/debug-parser.sh`
3. Verify scan completed: `docker exec homepage ls -la /var/www/site/scan/`
4. Check services.json: `docker exec homepage cat /var/www/site/services.json`

**Network scanning not working:**
- Ensure you're using `--network host` for reliable network access
- Check SUBNETS environment variable matches your network
- Verify container can reach network: `docker exec homepage ping 8.8.8.8`

**Container not starting:**
- Check logs: `docker logs homepage`
- Verify no port conflicts: `ss -ltnp | grep ':80'`
- Ensure Docker has network access

### Container Logs
```bash
docker logs -f homelab-homepage
```

Confirm it‚Äôs running:
```bash
docker ps --filter name=homelab-homepage
```

Test nginx from inside the container:
```bash
docker exec -it homelab-homepage sh -lc "curl -v http://127.0.0.1/"
```

Open firewall if needed (Ubuntu/Debian with UFW):
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

If the port is busy:
```bash
ss -ltnp | grep ':8080 '
```
